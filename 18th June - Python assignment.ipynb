It allows developers to track and analyze the behavior of their code, monitor application health, and debug issues.\n",

    "Debugging: Logging allows developers to capture and analyze the flow of execution, track the values of variables, and identify the cause of errors or unexpected behavior.\n",

    "Auditing: Logging enables the recording of important events, actions, or user interactions for auditing and compliance purposes.\n",
    "Troubleshooting: Logs can be invaluable in troubleshooting issues in production environments, as they provide a historical record of events leading up to an error or failure.\n",

    "The main differences between logging and print statements in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging is a more structured and flexible approach to output messages, specifically designed for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing the behavior of software applications.\n",
    "Logging provides log levels that allow you to control the severity and verbosity of messages, making it easier to filter and manage the output based on the specific needs of the application.\n",
    "Logging allows you to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a centralized manner, making it easier to organize and analyze the logs.\n",
    "Logging supports various output destinations, including console, files, network sockets, and external services, providing flexibility in storing and accessing logs.\n",
    "Logging allows you to format log messages and include additional information such as timestamps, log levels, and contextual details.\n",
    "Logging can be configured to write logs to multiple destinations simultaneously, enabling log aggregation and distribution.\n",
    "Logging provides built-in support for rotation, archiving, and retention policies for log files.\n",
    "Print statements, on the other hand, are primarily used for basic debugging or displaying temporary output during development. They are typically used for quick inspection of variables or intermediate values and are not meant for long-term or production-level logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world application, it is recommended to use logging over print statements because logging offers more control, flexibility, and scalability in capturing and managing log messages. It allows you to easily enable or disable specific log levels, redirect log output to different destinations, and customize the log format without modifying the code. Additionally, logging provides a structured approach that separates the concern of logging from the business logic of the application, making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase."
